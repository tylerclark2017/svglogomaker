# svglogomaker

## Description
This is a simple command line tool to generate SVG logos from text. It uses the shapes.js, test JS file, svg.js, test JS file, text.js, test JS file, and validColors.js to create the individual pieces necessary to generate an SVG logo. We used Jest to run the tests, and Inquirer and FS as dependencies. We utilized OOP to create classes, constructors, and "extends" for each in order to further demonstrate our growing knowledge of backend development, and created test files to test certain requirements for our application. 

## Disclosures
I had help from my tutor Alexis, as well as the Xpert Learning Assistant, to complete this project to as it stands now. 

##  Installation

Using node index.js to initialize the application to create your own SVG logo. 

##  Usage

1. Run `node index` in your terminal and follow the prompts:
- When asked for three letters, include three letters to help create your text.
- For colors, enter a color hexademical code or name.
- For shapes, choose between circle, triangle, and square. 
2. After you have completed all questions, an SVG file will be generated with your custom design! The filename will appear at the end of the prompts.
